\title{Apply conditions and sum corresponding coefficients}
\usage{
apply_conditions(model_config, data)

apply_conditions(model_config, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_config}{The specific model configuration list (e.g., \code{config[[model_name]]})
containing condition definitions.}

\item{data}{A list containing the input data, typically after transformations.
Condition formulas are evaluated against this data.}

\item{config}{A list representing the parsed YAML configuration.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the sum of coefficients for which
conditions were met.

A numeric value representing the sum of coefficients from all met conditions.
}
\description{
This function evaluates a series of conditions based on the input data
and sums the coefficients associated with the true conditions.

This function processes the 'conditions' block from the configuration.
For each defined condition, it evaluates the boolean expression in the context
of the input data. If true, it resolves the specified coefficient path within
the model's configuration and adds it to a running total.
